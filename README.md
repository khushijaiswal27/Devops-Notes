# My DevOps Journey - Day 1 🚀

Today, I watched the first lecture of Technical Guftgu. 

### What I learned:
* I understood the basic concept of DevOps (the "Why" and "What").
* I learned about how software moves from planning to the final stage (SDLC).
* Most importantly, I set up my environment: LinkedIn, GitHub, and Ubuntu Terminal.

*Sharing my handwritten rough notes below just to keep a record of my start!*

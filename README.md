# My DevOps Journey 🚀

### Day 1: Introduction to DevOps
I started my DevOps journey today with Technical Guftgu. In the first lecture, I focused on understanding the core concepts:

* **What is DevOps:** Understanding the bridge between Development and Operations.
* **SDLC Process:** How software is planned, built, and delivered.
* **Why DevOps:** The importance of automation and speed in modern tech.

*Note: I have attached my handwritten rough notes below to track my daily progress.*

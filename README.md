# My DevOps Journey - Day 1 🚀

Today, I watched the first lecture of Technical Guftgu. 

### What I learned:
* I understood the basic concept of DevOps (the "Why" and "What").
* I learned about how software moves from planning to the final stage (SDLC).
* Most importantly, I set up my environment: LinkedIn, GitHub, and Ubuntu Terminal.

*Sharing my handwritten rough notes below just to keep a record of my start!*

## Day 2: DevOps Lifecycle & Agile Methodology 🔄

Today, I focused on how teams collaborate and the various stages involved in software delivery.

### What I learned:
* The importance of coordination between Development and Operations teams to eliminate "Silos".
* The difference between the Waterfall model (step-by-step approach) and Agile methodology (working in Sprints/fast cycles).
**CI/CD pipeline- *Understanding the automation flow—Continuous Integration (using Git/Jenkins) and Continuous Deployment (using Maven).
* **DevOps Lifecycle:** Studying the "Infinity Loop" process, covering everything from Planning and Coding to Monitoring.

*Note: I have added my handwritten diagrams of the DevOps logo and Agile framework in the repository!*

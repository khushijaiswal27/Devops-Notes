## Day 21: Shell Scripting DevOps Projects Portfolio

## Task 25 :
You are a system administrator responsible for managing a network of servers. Every day, a log file is generated on each server containing important system events and error messages. Your job is to analyze these log files, identify specific events, and generate a summary report.

Write a Bash script (`log_analyzer.sh`) that automates the process of analyzing log files and generating a daily summary report.

---

## Expected Output
- A Bash script: `log_analyzer.sh`
- A generated summary report: `log_report_<date>.txt`
- A markdown file: `day-20-solution.md` documenting your approach

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Input and Validation
Your script should:
1. Accept the path to a log file as a command-line argument
2. Exit with a clear error message if no argument is provided
3. Exit with a clear error message if the file doesn't exist

---

### Task 2: Error Count
1. Count the total number of lines containing the keyword `ERROR` or `Failed`
2. Print the total error count to the console

---

### Task 3: Critical Events
1. Search for lines containing the keyword `CRITICAL`
2. Print those lines along with their line number

Example output:
```
--- Critical Events ---
Line 84: 2025-07-29 10:15:23 CRITICAL Disk space below threshold
Line 217: 2025-07-29 14:32:01 CRITICAL Database connection lost
```

---

### Task 4: Top Error Messages
1. Extract all lines containing `ERROR`
2. Identify the **top 5 most common** error messages
3. Display them with their occurrence count, sorted in descending order

Example output:
```
--- Top 5 Error Messages ---
45 Connection timed out
32 File not found
28 Permission denied
15 Disk I/O error
9  Out of memory
```

---

### Task 5: Summary Report
Generate a summary report to a text file named `log_report_<date>.txt` (e.g., `log_report_2026-02-11.txt`). The report should include:
1. Date of analysis
2. Log file name
3. Total lines processed
4. Total error count
5. Top 5 error messages with their occurrence count
6. List of critical events with line numbers

---

### Task 6 (Optional): Archive Processed Logs
Add a feature to:
1. Create an `archive/` directory if it doesn't exist
2. Move the processed log file into `archive/` after analysis
3. Print a confirmation message

---

## Sample Log File

A sample log file is available in this directory: `sample_log.log`

You can also pick real-world log datasets from the [LogHub repository](https://github.com/logpai/loghub) to test your script against production-like logs (e.g., ZooKeeper, HDFS, Apache, Linux syslogs).

---

## Hints
- Count errors: `grep -c "ERROR" logfile.log`
- Print with line numbers: `grep -n "CRITICAL" logfile.log`
- Top occurrences: `grep "ERROR" logfile.log | awk '{$1=$2=$3=""; print}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -5`
- Associative arrays: `declare -A error_map`
- Date for filename: `date +%Y-%m-%d`
- Move files: `mv logfile.log archive/`

---

## Documentation

Create `day-20-solution.md` with:
- Your script's code
- Sample output from running against the sample log
- What commands/tools you used (`grep`, `awk`, `sort`, `uniq`, etc.)
- What you learned (3 key points)

---

## Task 26 :


You've spent the last several days learning Shell scripting — from basics to real-world projects. Now it's time to consolidate everything into a **personal cheat sheet** that you can use as a quick-reference guide for the rest of your DevOps journey.

The best way to revise is to **teach it back**. Writing a cheat sheet forces you to organize your understanding and identify gaps.

---

## Expected Output
- A markdown file: `shell_scripting_cheatsheet.md`

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Basics
Document the following with short descriptions and examples:
1. Shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) — what it does and why it matters
2. Running a script — `chmod +x`, `./script.sh`, `bash script.sh`
3. Comments — single line (`#`) and inline
4. Variables — declaring, using, and quoting (`$VAR`, `"$VAR"`, `'$VAR'`)
5. Reading user input — `read`
6. Command-line arguments — `$0`, `$1`, `$#`, `$@`, `$?`

---

### Task 2: Operators and Conditionals
Document with examples:
1. String comparisons — `=`, `!=`, `-z`, `-n`
2. Integer comparisons — `-eq`, `-ne`, `-lt`, `-gt`, `-le`, `-ge`
3. File test operators — `-f`, `-d`, `-e`, `-r`, `-w`, `-x`, `-s`
4. `if`, `elif`, `else` syntax
5. Logical operators — `&&`, `||`, `!`
6. Case statements — `case ... esac`

---

### Task 3: Loops
Document with examples:
1. `for` loop — list-based and C-style
2. `while` loop
3. `until` loop
4. Loop control — `break`, `continue`
5. Looping over files — `for file in *.log`
6. Looping over command output — `while read line`

---

### Task 4: Functions
Document with examples:
1. Defining a function — `function_name() { ... }`
2. Calling a function
3. Passing arguments to functions — `$1`, `$2` inside functions
4. Return values — `return` vs `echo`
5. Local variables — `local`

---

### Task 5: Text Processing Commands
Document the most useful flags/patterns for each:
1. `grep` — search patterns, `-i`, `-r`, `-c`, `-n`, `-v`, `-E`
2. `awk` — print columns, field separator, patterns, `BEGIN/END`
3. `sed` — substitution, delete lines, in-place edit
4. `cut` — extract columns by delimiter
5. `sort` — alphabetical, numerical, reverse, unique
6. `uniq` — deduplicate, count
7. `tr` — translate/delete characters
8. `wc` — line/word/char count
9. `head` / `tail` — first/last N lines, follow mode

---

### Task 6: Useful Patterns and One-Liners
Include at least 5 real-world one-liners you find useful. Examples:
- Find and delete files older than N days
- Count lines in all `.log` files
- Replace a string across multiple files
- Check if a service is running
- Monitor disk usage with alerts
- Parse CSV or JSON from command line
- Tail a log and filter for errors in real time

---

### Task 7: Error Handling and Debugging
Document with examples:
1. Exit codes — `$?`, `exit 0`, `exit 1`
2. `set -e` — exit on error
3. `set -u` — treat unset variables as error
4. `set -o pipefail` — catch errors in pipes
5. `set -x` — debug mode (trace execution)
6. Trap — `trap 'cleanup' EXIT`

---

### Task 8: Bonus — Quick Reference Table
Create a summary table like this at the top of your cheat sheet:

| Topic | Key Syntax | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Variable | `VAR="value"` | `NAME="DevOps"` |
| Argument | `$1`, `$2` | `./script.sh arg1` |
| If | `if [ condition ]; then` | `if [ -f file ]; then` |
| For loop | `for i in list; do` | `for i in 1 2 3; do` |
| Function | `name() { ... }` | `greet() { echo "Hi"; }` |
| Grep | `grep pattern file` | `grep -i "error" log.txt` |
| Awk | `awk '{print $1}' file` | `awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd` |
| Sed | `sed 's/old/new/g' file` | `sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' config.txt` |

---

## Format Guidelines

Your cheat sheet should be:
- Written in **Markdown** (`.md`)
- Organized with **clear headings** for each section
- Include **code blocks** with syntax highlighting (` ```bash `)
- Keep explanations **short** — 1-2 lines max per item
- Focus on **practical examples** over theory
- Something **you would actually refer back to** on the job

This repository contains real-world Shell Scripts developed during Day 21 of the Shell Scripting Masterclass. These projects focus on automating System Administration and monitoring tasks.

🛠 Projects Documentation
1. 👤 User Management Automation (Project 1)
File: create_user.sh

Purpose: To automate the process of adding a new local user with a secure, auto-generated password.

Logic: 1. Root Check: Verifies if the script is run by a user with Root privileges (UID 0).
2. Input Handling: Takes the username as a command-line argument ($1) and treating the rest as comments.
3. Password Generation: Automatically creates a unique password using date +%s%N.
4. Security: Forces the user to change their password on the very first login (passwd -e).

2. 📂 Automated File Archiving & Backup (Project 2)
File: archive_project.sh

Purpose: To identify large files (20MB+) and compress them into a backup folder to save disk space.

Logic:

Search: Uses the find command to locate files based on size (-size +20M) and type (-f).

Compression: Applies gzip to shrink file sizes.

Migration: Moves compressed .gz files to a dedicated /archive folder.

Automation: Can be scheduled via Crontab to run every night at 2:00 AM.

3. 📊 RAM Monitoring Script (Project 3)
File: ram_monitor.sh

Purpose: To track system memory health and alert the admin when the server is running low on RAM.

Logic: Uses free -m to extract memory stats and awk to target the free memory column. If free memory is below a certain threshold (e.g., 500MB), it triggers a warning on the terminal.

📧 4. Disk Usage Alert with Email (Project 4)
File: disk_alert.sh

Purpose: To monitor disk partition usage and send an automated email alert if usage exceeds a set limit.

Logic: Parses the df -h command to check usage percentage. Integrates with Postfix (Mail Server) to send a notification to the SysAdmin for immediate action.

🔑 Key Learnings (Day 21 Focus)
Real-World Automation: Moving from simple commands to building end-to-end solutions.

Error Handling: Using exit statuses ($?) to ensure scripts stop if a command fails.

Advanced Find & Grep: Filtering system data precisely for monitoring.

Crontab Scheduling: Implementing background automation for maintenance tasks.
